# <p align="center"> Exxeta Challenge @ Q-Hack 2025 </p>

## Build AI Agents for Smart Staffing

### üìÑ Problem Statement

In this hackathon, the challenge is to build a service or application that connects consultants with fitting projects by leveraging Multi-Agent AI Systems. Tech students are invited to explore how intelligent agent collaboration can bridge the gap between individual profiles and project needs, creating smarter, more dynamic connections. Whether it‚Äôs through skill-based matching, smart recommendations, or automated coordination, the aim is to let AI assist in establishing meaningful partnerships. Participants are encouraged to explore different approaches, experiment with agent roles, and develop solutions that make these processes more efficient.

### üõ†Ô∏è **The Application That is Built**

- An application that intelligently matches consultants with relevant projects based on their profiles and project requirements.  
- A database consisting of consultant profiles and project descriptions.  
- A user-friendly interface where project owners and consultants can view matches, track progress, and receive insights on the relevance of connections.  

### üíª Technology Stack Suggestions

We encourage teams to freely choose their tech stack up to their liking or past experiences. Below are the recommended technologies:

#### AI Workflow

- Use n8n, pydantic, or a similar AI orchestration framework as the service layer to automate workflows and integrate AI functionalities into the matching process.  

#### Web Development

- Next.js or other JavaScript frameworks in combination with Spring Boot and MongoDB for developing a responsive and robust frontend and backend in a classical service-oriented architecture.  

#### Cloud Ready Architecture

- Utilize containerization to deploy to the provided AWS or Azure Cloud environment.  

### ‚úÖ Deliverables of the Challenge

- A working prototype of the AI-Powered Staffing Platform (frontend, backend, and AI service integration).  
- A presentation that includes:
  - Problem statement and solution overview  
  - Architectural diagram showing how multi-agent AI connects consultants and projects  
  - Demonstration of the prototype in action  
  - Future roadmap and potential extension of the solution  
  - (optional) Cloud deployment

### üß∞ Provided Resources 

- Access to cloud computing resources (AWS or Azure) for hosting and running the application  
- Access to consultant profile and project description samples  
- Mentoring sessions with experts in AI, cloud computing, and business process automation

### üèÜ Additional Prizes for Challenge Winner

The winner of our challenge will meet us in person in one of our offices
