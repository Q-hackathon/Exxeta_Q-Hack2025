# Exxeta Challenge @ Q-Hack 2025

## Build AI Agents for Smart Staffing

### üìÑ Overview

In this hackathon, the challenge is to build a service or application that connects consultants with fitting projects by leveraging Multi-Agent AI Systems. Tech students are invited to explore how intelligent agent collaboration can bridge the gap between individual profiles and project needs, creating smarter, more dynamic connections. Whether it‚Äôs through skill-based matching, smart recommendations, or automated coordination, the aim is to let AI assist in establishing meaningful partnerships. Participants are encouraged to explore different approaches, experiment with agent roles, and develop solutions that make these processes more efficient.

### üéØ Target Group

- Students interested in artificial intelligence, automation, and business process optimization  
- Students with skills in web development, backend infrastructure, and AI service integration  
- Aspiring entrepreneurs and developers looking to create impactful solutions for connecting talent and opportunities in businesses  

### üõ†Ô∏è The Application We Will Build ‚Äì AI-Powered Staffing Platform

- An application that intelligently matches consultants with relevant projects based on their profiles and project requirements.  
- A database consisting of consultant profiles and project descriptions.  
- A user-friendly interface where project owners and consultants can view matches, track progress, and receive insights on the relevance of connections.  

### üíª Technology Stack Suggestions

We encourage teams to freely choose their tech stack up to their liking or past experiences. Below are the recommended technologies:
